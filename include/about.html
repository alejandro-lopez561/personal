                <p>My name is Luis Alejandro, but I would rather Alejandro&nbsp;üòè.</p>
                <p>I‚Äôm from Colombia üá®üá¥, and I‚Äôm currently located in Bogot√°, the capital. <br>Bogot√° is one of the cities with the highest demand of developers and tech companies in the&nbsp;country.</p>
                <p>
                    This story does not start in Bogot√° though, because at the end of 2017, I travelled abroad for the first time in my&nbsp;life.

                    I went to Australia and lived there for 3 years. I studied, worked, and made a life there pursuing one goal: becoming a better person by improving personal, academic and professional. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    During my stay, I went on some trips visiting different countries, learned a bit about their culture and their beauty, but the most important thing, I went to Australia to learn and improve my English skills as a second language, and also turning my life 180&nbsp;degrees.

                    I started to study programming, almost 7 months after I got to Australia, and since then, 
                    I knew that coding is what I wanna do&nbsp;always.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, it went really well, I could even work over there as a Front-End Developer.
                    Now, I have aussie, local and North American experience at coding.

                    Beggining 2021, I got back to Colombia with a purpose, improve myself everyday as a developer. 
                    I really love being a developer because is you wanna be good at coding, you gotta learn every single day.
                    So, I've learned a lot, but there is a lot to learn still. 
                    Working on&nbsp;that!
                </p> 
                <p>So, this is me, and by the way, I‚Äôm back because of these smart, affectionate, kind and pretty girls ...                           
                </p>
                <p>Yes, they are my daughters! And as I was saying, I'm back because of my family, and because I wanna build a good future for me and for them here, also I wanna build something that helps people or solves a problem, and always looking forward to create value in every place, company or client I work with.
