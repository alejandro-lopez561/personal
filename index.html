                    <p>My name is Luis Alejandro, but I would rather Alejandro üòè.</p>
                    <p>I‚Äôm from Colombia üá®üá¥, and I‚Äôm currently located in Bogot√°, the capital. Bogot√° is one of the cities with the highest demand of developers and tech companies in the country.</p>
                    <br>
                    <p id="1">
                        But this story does not start here, because 3 years ago, I could travel abroad for the first time in my life.
                        I lived in Australia for the last 3 years, I could visit different countries, learn a bit about their culture and their beauty, but the most important thing, I went to Australia to learn and improve my skills in a second language, and also turning 180 degrees in my life. I started to study programming, almost 7 months after I arrived, and since then, I knew that this is what I wanna do always.
                        So, it went really well, I could even work over there, as a Front end developer, and know you are reading this first version of my personal website.
                        2 months ago, I got back to Colombia, with a lot learned, but a lot to learn still, and being honest, one of the things that I really love being a developer is there‚Äôs something to learn every single day.</p> 
                        <br>
                        <p class="right">So, this is me, and by the way, I‚Äôm back because of them...                           <span class="bigger"><i class="fas fa-location-arrow"></i></span>              </p>
                        <p>Yes, they are my daughters! And as I was saying, I'm back because of my family, and because I wanna build something in here, something that helps someone or solves something, and create value thinking about a better place for my beautiful princesses.
                        Anyway, I will tell you more abut my technical skills in a sec.

                    <p>
                        Let's be honest!, it's a silly app. But the point here, is what i managed to do. I created a simple react Js app to render cards, with monster‚Äôs information and with a search-box to filter out the "monsters", feeding the card component with an API that generates the name and the email.
I'm not using Redux for this one, but I'll soon, once I get on track of the e-commerce app I‚Äôm building right now.
So, for the state, I lifted up to the App component, and from there,
Using the setState property, I handled to use the state and update the state at the same time the user types inside the search-box, to show immediately the monsters who match the search.

                    <p>
                        This is a functional-based app. This small app, helps people to quickly get an idea of their budget of the current month. I built this app using the concepts of OOP, using IIFE's
                        and a proper structure to be able to join every module with each other.
                        I used objects, arrays, array's methods, functions and of course, DOM manipulation.

                    <p>
                        This is a game based on a set of rules previously given, where a couple of players can roll the dice and
                        hold the score, update de points to win and unlock the dice after a winner shows up by clicking on the new game button.
                        This project was built using functions, booleans to be able to set or change the game state, validations and DOM manipulation.
